Subscribeme
===========

This acts as a proxy to the Twitter API to expose an unauthenticated RSS feed
for your Twitter timeline, allowing you to use any RSS reader (including Google
Reader) as a read-only Twitter client.

Note: The feed you get back is unauthenticated (so you can use it in Google
Reader, for example). However, this means that anyone with the URL generated by
this service can read your Twitter timeline (tweets posted by people you
follow). It WILL NOT expose direct messages or any other non-public
information, but don't share the URL if you don't want someone else following
all the people you follow.

You can see this software in action at http://jamur2-subscribeme.appspot.com,
but feel free to run your own instance.  It fits well within the "free" pricing
tier in Google App Engine.
